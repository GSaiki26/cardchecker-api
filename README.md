[![Check code](https://github.com/GSaiki26/cardchecker-api/actions/workflows/code.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/GSaiki26/cardchecker-api/actions/workflows/code.yaml)

The cardchecker api is a nodeJS application created to manage checks that are sent by the cardchecker-client.
It's basically a card control application.

## Usage

This project need the `worker.proto`, that can be found in the:
[Workers API](https://github.com/GSaiki26/workers-api) repos.

It's also use TLS, so you need to create the CA certificates and the server certiticates.
To do it execute the commands above:

```sh
CA_SUBJ="/CN=ca";
SERVER_SUBJ="/CN=cardchecker-api";

mkdir certs; cd certs;
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -out ./ca.pem -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ./ca.pem.key -subj "$CA_SUBJ";
openssl req -new -nodes -out ./server.csr -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout ./server.pem.key -subj "$SERVER_SUBJ";
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in ./server.csr -out ./server.pem -CA ./ca.pem -CAkey ./ca.pem.key;
```

## Env file

This project uses 2 envs file: 1 to the Postgres Database and 1 to the API.
The database's env just uses a `POSTGRES_USER` and a `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`.
Otherwise, the API uses these envs:

| Name           | Default value   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| K8S_ENABLED    | false           | Set to `enable` if you're using Kubernetes in your project.<br />If this option is marked as `false`, the nodeJS will use the Cluster module, so the project'll become multi-CPU.                              |
| MAIL_CC        | MAIL_CC         | Define all the MAIL's options to use the `node-mailer`. This field is used to define the CC from the mail.                                                                                                       |
| MAIL_USER      | MAIL_USER       | This field is used to define the email owner.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| MAIL_PASSWD    | MAIL_PASSWD     | This field is used to define the password from the email. If using google mail, checkout this doc: [Google Apps Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en).                                   |
| MASTER_KEY     | MASTER_KEY      | This field is used to define the masterkey. By default, all the incoming requests are readen with normal previleges since all they have a certificate signed by the CA. But some features use a higher permission. |
| WORKER_API_URI | worker-api:3000 | This field is used to define the uri to the `worker-api`. You need to setup this api in order to use this application. You can clone this repos:Â [worker-api](https://github.com/GSaiki26/worker-api).             |
